## Project Name

Movie Selection

## Description

Duration: 2 days

The task at hand was to use existing code to create a functioning app that would allow for a user to add a new movie to the already existing along with details, a cover, and a movie category,

The tasks were:
1. Allow for navigation to different pages that would allow you to see the details of existing movies on the list or, to add a new movie to the list.

2. Make sure that when navigated to the specific movie, the movie details and the movie categories that it falls under appear on the DOM.

3. Once at the Details page, allow for a button to return to the home screen to view more movies.

4. Create a navigation button to move the user to a page where they can add a movie of their choice to the list.

5. Once at the add a new movie page, the user can add the title, a description of the movie, a url linking to a photo of the movie, and lastly select a category for the movie to be placed in. 

6. As the user finishes with inputing the data. In order to save the new movie details the user will then click a save button to save the movie list in a database.

7. If the user decides to change their mind on adding a new movie, the user has an option to navigate back to the home page via, cancel button.

8. Lastly, if a new movie was saved, navigation will take the user back to the home page where the new movie should appear on the movie list.

# Required Steps

Create a database named sagas_movies_weekend

The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. 
    
The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. 
    
We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,

1. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
2. Run npm run server in your terminal
3. Run npm run client in your terminal
    
The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!

# Built with:
